# Arch Technologies – Data Science Internship

This repository showcases my work for the Data Science
Internship program at Arch Technologies.

Across two months, I worked on predictive modeling
and clustering techniques using Python and scikit-learn.

The experience enhanced my practical skills in
data cleaning, feature selection, model building,
and result interpretation.
